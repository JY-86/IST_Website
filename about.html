                Join Batman once again as he faces a threat bigger than anything which has ever plagued Gotham City. Batman has defeated skilled criminals before, but the Joker is the new face on the block who is testing everything that Batman is capable of. A violent, psychopathic murderer, the Joker will stop at nothing to see his cloaked arch-nemesis lying face down in the dirt. Not only is Gotham City in dire need of a saviour, but the Joker has captured those Batman holds most dear, forcing him to choose between the good of the city and himself. Aided by Comissioner Gordon and Harvey Dent, Batman must overcome his inner demons and restore order to Gotham City.

                        The iconic character returns once again. Attempting to avenge his parents, murdered cruelly by the lowest depths of Gotham's criminal underbelly,
                        Bruce Wayne adopts a dual persona of billionaire playboy by day, and masked vigilante by night. He has dedicated his life to an 
                        endless crusade - a war on all criminals polluting the streets of Gotham City. However, when he encounters a criminal unlike any he has
                        faced before, all of Batman's fortitude will be put to the test.

                        The Joker is a homicidal artist and an agent of chaos - an embodiment of everything Batman fights against. The very name alone
                        strikes terror into the hearts of Gothamâ€™s citizens, and in a city overrun by criminals, he looms above them all. A complete psychopath,
                        he will stop at nothing to bring destruction to Batman and everything he cares about. Having taken control of the mobs of the city,
                        he plans to put an end to Batman once and for all.

                        The Dark Knight's greatest ally, commissioner James Gordon is a stalwart defender of Gotham City. A veteran cop who has worked tirelessly
                        to rise through the ranks, Gordon will have to decide whether the unregulated vigilantism of Batman is a threat to Gotham city, or
                        the exact panacea that the city is in desperate need of. A difficult decision looms on him - whether to become Batman's closest ally
                        or most dogged enemy.

                        However, the twisted and rotten underbelly of Gotham City is too widespread to be exposed by one man, and Harvey Dent finds himself
                        becoming a victim to everything he sought to destroy, and the embodiement of all that he fought against.
